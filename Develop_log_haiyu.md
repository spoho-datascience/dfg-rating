## logs
### 2024.07.03-04
reading code
consider national network first, don't consider multi-season, no promotion first
finished control number of teams per league, prob of games inter league, one leg control
Principle is not change existing code, adding functions..

### 2024.07.05
two ways to build a international network:
* create country league, re-lable and compose country networks (call countryleague class)
in this way, the function between nations may need to rewrite in the future.

* create a big graph first, then cluster nation, cluster leagues (edit from CountryLeague class)
in this way, the country league class should able to handle specific given team_id
Seems some functions in the RoundRobin cannot be used instantly by given team_id
Finished given team_id network build in countryLeague() (changed teams_list generate in RoundRobin (line 35-53))

### 2024.07.06
finished the structure of composing national network in international network

### 2024.07.08
finish the international network's country config reading
tested the national network with 3 levels, with same true_rating and true_forecasting

### 2024.07.09
finish the rating part of nation network, can control each level's rating now (added a new_cluster_rating function in ControlledRandomFunction)

### 2024.07.10
finish the forecast part of nation network
fixed the rating problem (fix the rating_values sent to self._add_rating_to_team)
tested national network with different team number setting, diff rating setting

### 2024.07.15
read the Ranking Rating code
finish the promotion and relegation structure, the logic in LeagueNetwork is quite simple, will not just use it

### 2024.07.16
Add the Ranking function, based on ranking after each season select promotion and relegation
Finish the logic that each rating only matters with each team, doesn't matter which level the team is in

### 2024.07.17
Add multi season, tested multi season promotion and relegation
One problem existing is when calculate ranking, considered all matches (including national cup)
International league is gonna based on countryLeague network

### 2024.07.18
Will change code to function def later
fixed ranking for each team, only get rank score within their division matches
rating follow with teams promotion and relegation

### 2024.07.24
change code to function: select_teams(), set_edge_state(), initiate_levels()
simplify logic to initiate different levels

### 2024.07.25
Based on the talk with Fabian, add a relegation for 3rd division league

### 2024.07.30
added add_rating function, modify init_cluster_ratings()
add two modes in add_rating(), can choose team keep it's rating when promoted/relegated, or use 'mix' mode, that will calculate the mean rating_diff at the end of last season, and add this diff into the promoted/relegated team
simple promotion and relegation logic


### 2024.07.31
tested international graph generate and graph combine

### 2024.08.06
talked with Marc, the NationalNetwork and InternationalNetwork can be generated by a small graph, which nodes just pointing to the nodes where the RoundRobinNetwork they belong to..
- [] To be fixed: separate the rating get and rating calculate step. Fix the rating calculation method.
- [] Generate a new rating class with same name of function instead of get_cluster_raitng()

### 2024.08.08
finished international graph with forecast adding and play network
tested international network
- [] visualization InternationalNetwork, need adaptation to baseNetwork

### 2024.08.12
finish the interchange rating mode

### 2024.08.13
fix interchange rating mode
